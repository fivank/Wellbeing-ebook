# Chapter 1 — Growth, Wellbeing, and the Affordability of Life

## A small thought experiment

Imagine a country as a busy theatre.

GDP is the total value of all the tickets sold, snacks bought, and stage sets built.

Wellbeing is whether the audience can comfortably afford to come in the first place—and whether they enjoy the show once they’re inside.

These two things often move together, but they are not the same. A theatre can brag about record ticket sales while half the town watches from outside the glass.

This book starts by setting the scoreboard correctly. We will use the standard economic measures—GDP, income, inflation, and purchasing power—but we will keep asking a simple, human question:

> Can a typical household afford the essentials of life without falling into unsustainable debt?

To answer that question cleanly, we need a few definitions that people often mix up: GDP vs. GNI, real vs. nominal, PPP, and median vs. mean. Once these are locked in, the rest of the book becomes much easier to follow.

## 1.1 GDP is production, not a life story

### What GDP is

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the value of goods and services produced inside a country’s borders in a given period. It is a production measure: a national total, not a household experience.

That matters because production can rise even when everyday life feels tighter—especially when the gains go mostly to the top, or when essential costs rise faster than pay.

### GDP vs. GNI (a common confusion)

GDP is not the only big national number. Another one is Gross National Income (GNI).

A simple way to remember the difference:

- **GDP:** Where was it produced? (inside the border)
- **GNI:** Who ultimately earns the income? (the nation’s residents/owners)

The Bureau of Economic Analysis defines GNI as income earned by residents—equal to domestic income plus income received from the rest of the world minus income paid to the rest of the world.
In short: GDP is about location of production, GNI is about ownership and income flows.

### Why this difference matters (without getting fancy)

Picture a factory built in your country but owned abroad. It boosts GDP because production happens locally. But the profits may flow out, so local residents may not feel richer in the way GDP suggests.

Or flip it: your country’s companies earn profits overseas. That may lift GNI even if local production is flat.

Lesson: GDP is a useful number, but it is not the same thing as what a typical family can afford.

## 1.2 Nominal vs. real: the money number and the meaning number

Here is the easiest trap to fall into:

- You hear wages are “up.”
- You feel poorer anyway.

That is often the difference between nominal and real.

- **Nominal** means measured in money terms (dollars, euros, yen).
- **Real** means adjusted for purchasing power—what your money can actually buy.

As Econlib puts it: the nominal price is the value in money; the real (or relative) price is value measured against a bundle of other goods or services.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis makes the same point: nominal values are the money used in a transaction, while real values adjust for inflation.

### A quick example

If your pay rises 5% but your cost of living rises 5%, then your real situation is roughly unchanged. You have a bigger number on your payslip, but not a bigger life.

And now the extra twist—one that matters a lot for wellbeing:

> Not everyone faces the same inflation.

If essentials like housing and food rise faster than everything else, then families who spend more on essentials can experience higher “felt inflation,” even when the headline inflation number looks moderate.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that after inflation peaked in June 2022, households in the bottom 40% of the income distribution experienced higher inflation than the average household, with a gap that persisted through late 2022 and into 2024, fluctuating roughly between 0.25 and 0.50 percentage points.

Lesson: Real wellbeing is not just “wages vs. inflation.” It is “wages vs. your inflation,” shaped by what you must buy to live.

## 1.3 Mean vs. median: the average person who doesn’t exist

When people say “the average worker,” they often mean the mean (the arithmetic average). But in a world with high inequality, the mean can float above most people’s lived reality—like a hot-air balloon tethered to a few very large incomes.

The median is different. It is the “middle” value: half the people earn less, half earn more.

The Social Security Administration explains this clearly for wage data: the median wage is the wage “in the middle,” and the median is “substantially less than the average” because the wage distribution is highly skewed.

### Why this matters for a wellbeing-focused book

If income growth mostly goes to the top, the mean can rise while the median barely moves. You will hear good news in headlines while the “typical” household wonders if everyone is living on a different planet.

So in this book, whenever we want to talk about the “typical” experience, we will lean on medians and distribution-aware measures—not just national totals.

## 1.4 PPP: comparing countries without fooling yourself

Now let’s travel—at least on paper.

If you compare incomes across countries using market exchange rates alone, you can get distorted results, because prices differ widely between places.

That’s what Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is for.

The World Bank defines PPP conversion as a way to equalize purchasing power by eliminating differences in price levels between countries, allowing volume comparisons of GDP and related components.
Their PPP guide explains the intuition: PPPs let you convert the cost of a basket of goods and services into a common currency while eliminating price level differences.

### GDP per person still isn’t the same as wellbeing

Even with PPP, GDP per capita is not automatically a wellbeing measure. It can be inflated by special cases—like tax structures, large multinational profits, or industry mixes that don’t translate into everyday living standards.

The OECD points out that GDP per capita is “not the best indicator to compare material well-being.” It highlights that Actual Individual Consumption (AIC)—what households consume, including services provided by government and non-profits (like health and education)—is often a better wellbeing comparison tool.

Lesson: If you want to compare how ordinary people live, you care less about “how large the economy is” and more about “what households can actually consume.”

## 1.5 The core lens: affordability of essentials

Now we come to the centre of the book: the “welfare output” that matters most day to day.

A household’s life is not an abstract chart. It is a monthly sequence of bills and needs. The essentials usually include:

- housing (rent or mortgage + basic utilities)
- food
- energy (home + getting around)
- healthcare
- childcare (for families with children)
- transport

If these essentials become too expensive relative to income, people lose freedom. They delay medical care, skip savings, work extra hours, postpone having children, or take on debt just to stay afloat. The economy can still “grow” during all of this—but the growth is not translating into broad wellbeing.

### A reality check from household spending data

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 2024, average annual expenditures were $78,535. In spending shares, housing was 33.4%, transportation 17.0%, food 12.9%, and healthcare 7.9%.

Even without perfect precision, the shape of the problem is obvious:

> A large share of the typical budget is concentrated in categories that feel non-optional.

You can delay buying a new phone. You cannot easily delay rent.

### Housing: the biggest anchor in the room

Housing cost burden is commonly defined as spending more than 30% of income on housing; severe burden is more than 50%.

A recent analysis summarized by Novogradac reports that in 2024, 33% of households faced cost burdens and 21.6 million households were severely cost burdened (spending more than half their income on housing).
The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies similarly notes that homeowner cost burdens reached very high levels in 2024, with 20.7 million cost-burdened homeowner households (24% of homeowners), and highlights that roughly half of newly burdened homeowners were older adults.

This is what “GDP is rising” can hide: a country can produce more while housing takes a larger bite out of everyday life.

### Childcare: a bill that can equal a second rent

For many families, childcare is not a “nice-to-have.” It is the bridge that allows parents to work.

The U.S. Department of Labor reports that U.S. families spend between 8.9% and 16.0% of their median income on full-day care for one child, with annual prices ranging from $6,552 to $15,600 (2022 data, the most recent available in that report). It also notes the median annual cost of rent was $15,216 in 2022.

That comparison lands like a dropped plate:

> In many places, childcare can be rent-sized.

### Energy: the invisible tax on low income

Energy costs are strange because they are both basic and easy to underestimate—until the bill arrives.

The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy reports that one in four low-income households spend more than 15% of income on energy bills.
ACEEE also finds that when you combine home energy and transportation fuel, low-income households spend 17.8% of income on these costs, and that this is more than three times the national average.

This matters because “small” monthly bills become huge when income is tight. A cost that is annoying for a high-income household can be destabilizing for a low-income one.

### Inflation is not a single experience

Finally, affordability is dynamic: it changes with prices.

When inflation hits essentials, the pain is not evenly shared. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that after the June 2022 peak, the bottom 40% of households experienced higher inflation than the headline measure, with a persistent gap (roughly 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points for a time).

This is why two people can live in the same country, see the same inflation headline, and feel like they inhabit different economies.

## Closing: what we will track from here

GDP is a useful national statistic. It tells us something real about production capacity and change over time.

But it is not a direct measure of wellbeing. So from this point onward, we will treat GDP as a starting point, not a verdict.

We will keep translating “growth” into questions people actually live with:

- How much of income is consumed by essentials?
- How do costs differ by age, region, and class?
- When the economy expands, who gains purchasing power?
- When prices rise, whose basket gets hit hardest?

In the next chapter, we add one more simple lens that clears up a surprising amount of confusion:

> GDP = Population × GDP per capita

It is an identity that sounds too basic to matter—until you notice how often it is ignored.
