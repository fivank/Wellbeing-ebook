# Chapter 1 — Growth, Wellbeing and the Affordability of Life

## Introduction: More than a Scoreboard

Most public debates about prosperity focus on **gross domestic product (GDP)**—the total value of everything produced in a country.  The outline for this book makes clear that GDP is not the same thing as living standards: it measures production but hides how income is distributed and what ordinary families can afford【604289711686708†L23-L28】.  Throughout this chapter we build the foundations for a more meaningful scoreboard by clarifying the main economic measures and then turning to the affordability of essential goods and services.

## 1.1 GDP versus GNI – Production vs Income

**GDP measures production within a country’s borders.**  It is calculated by adding together consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports minus imports).  The formula is:

\[\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)\]

Because GDP counts everything produced within the territory, it includes output by foreign firms operating locally.  As Tutor2u explains, GDP is “the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders”【33422195526201†L175-L186】.

**Gross National Income (GNI) measures the income earned by residents, wherever it comes from.**  GNI adds to GDP the net income residents receive from abroad—wages earned overseas and profits from foreign investments—and subtracts the income foreign residents take home.  Mathematically:

\[\text{GNI} = \text{GDP} + \text{Net income from abroad}\]

GNI therefore differs from GDP when countries have many citizens working overseas or when domestic production is dominated by foreign‑owned firms【33422195526201†L194-L211】.  In small open economies with multinational subsidiaries or large numbers of migrant workers, the gap between GDP and GNI can be sizeable.  Ireland’s GDP per person is famously high because foreign companies book profits there; its GNI per person is much lower once profits repatriated to parent companies are removed.  GDP tells us where production happens; GNI tells us who ultimately receives the income.

## 1.2 Means vs Medians – Why Averages Mislead

Another common mistake is to equate **average income** with the typical person’s standard of living.  The U.S. Social Security Administration’s wage statistics illustrate why this is misleading.  In 2023 the **average** net compensation was \$63 ,932, but the **median** worker earned \$43 ,223【973626928018500†L31-L68】.  In other words, half of workers earned less than \$43 ,223 while a small share of high earners pulled the average up; the ratio of the median to the average was only about 68 percent【973626928018500†L31-L68】.  This gap has persisted for decades because wage distributions are skewed.  Median income therefore provides a better sense of how a typical worker is doing than does an average that is distorted by those at the top.

## 1.3 Inflation and Real vs Nominal Values – Why Baskets Differ by Class

### Nominal vs real values

Economists distinguish between **nominal** and **real** values.  The nominal price of a good is its price in money terms, such as dollars or euros.  The real or relative price is the value of that good in terms of other goods or in terms of a fixed basket of goods over time【370514061976818†L80-L87】.  Converting nominal values to real ones by adjusting for inflation lets us see whether purchasing power has increased or decreased.

### Different households experience different inflation

Inflation is not uniform across society because families spend differently.  A recent commentary by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumption data to calculate an income‑specific consumer price index.  Their analysis shows that after the inflation spike of 2022, **households in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution faced inflation roughly 0.25–0.50 percentage points higher than the headline consumer price index**, while households in the top 20 percent faced inflation about 0.25 percentage points lower【487696743123867†L724-L734】.  Low‑income households spend a larger share on necessities like housing and food, whose prices rose sharply, whereas higher‑income households spend more on services that rose more slowly.

Wage growth also differed across groups.  During 2022 and early 2023, wages for workers in the bottom 40 percent grew about one percentage point faster than the median and about three points faster than wages in the top 20 percent【487696743123867†L736-L742】.  Cumulatively, the bottom 40 percent saw about **4.5 percentage points more wage growth than inflation** between 2019 and late 2024【487696743123867†L744-L751】.  These figures show why adjusting for both inflation and wage growth—using real incomes rather than nominal averages—is critical when assessing living standards.

## 1.4 Purchasing Power Parity – Making Cross‑Country Comparisons

Cross‑country income comparisons require more than simply converting currencies at market exchange rates.  **Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)** adjust national currencies so that a given basket of goods and services has the same price in each country.  The OECD notes that PPPs “serve both as currency converters and price deflators”【91517381116141†L67-L73】 and that they reveal large differences in material wellbeing that exchange rates obscure.  According to their 2025 “flash” estimates, **GDP per capita varied from around 2.5 times the OECD average (Luxembourg and Ireland) to about 40 percent of the average (Colombia and Mexico)** in 2024【91517381116141†L76-L83】.  The dispersion in **Actual Individual Consumption (AIC)** per person—a measure that captures what households actually consume—was narrower but still ranged from about 50 percent above the OECD average (United States) to 45 percent of it (Colombia)【91517381116141†L100-L106】.  PPPs also show how price levels differ: household final consumption price levels in 2023 ranged from about **50 percent above the OECD average in Switzerland to around 40 percent below in Türkiye**【91517381116141†L119-L133】.  These adjustments highlight why using PPP‑adjusted incomes or consumption gives a more accurate picture of living standards than using exchange‑rate converted GDP alone.

## 1.5 A Practical Welfare Lens – Can Households Afford the Essentials?

### Housing, food, transportation and healthcare

Government surveys of consumer spending reveal where most household budgets go.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Expenditure Survey for 2024 reports that **housing accounted for 33.4 percent of total expenditures**, **transportation 17.0 percent**, **food 12.9 percent** and **healthcare 7.9 percent**【721762134963299†L26-L40】.  These figures correspond to an average annual expenditure of \$78 ,535【721762134963299†L9-L14】, though households in the lowest income quintile spent far less on average.  Importantly, rising housing costs outpaced overall expenditure growth, with spending on owned dwellings rising 7 percent and rents 5.4 percent in 2024【721762134963299†L48-L53】【721762134963299†L171-L188】.

### Childcare costs

Childcare is another essential service that many families cannot avoid.  A 2024 U.S. Department of Labor update shows that **full‑day care for one child costs families between 8.9 percent and 16 percent of their median income**, with annual prices ranging from **\$6,552 to \$15,600**【657516871242664†L119-L125】.  Even part‑day care for school‑age children takes **8.1 percent to 9.4 percent of median income** (\$5,943 to \$9,211 per year)【657516871242664†L119-L125】.  For perspective, the median annual rent in 2022 was \$15,216【657516871242664†L124-L125】—similar to or lower than the cost of full‑day childcare in many places.  Such expenses often compel parents, particularly mothers, either to work longer hours to pay for care or to leave the workforce, affecting both household income and national productivity.

### Energy burdens

Energy costs, including home utilities and transport fuel, disproportionately affect low‑income households.  Research from the American Council for an Energy‑Efficient Economy (ACEEE) finds that **low‑income households spend on average 17.8 percent of their income on combined home energy and transportation fuel**, **more than three times the national average**【828884151234219†L144-L149】.  The ACEEE’s broader energy burden analysis notes that **one in four low‑income households faces energy burdens over 15 percent of income**【763836750998664†L143-L148】 and that **high energy burdens are defined as spending more than 6 percent of income on utilities, while severe burdens exceed 10 percent**【763836750998664†L175-L178】.  These burdens are often highest for Black and Hispanic households, exacerbating existing economic disparities【828884151234219†L151-L154】.

### Housing cost burdens

Housing affordability has deteriorated sharply.  Analysis of 2024 U.S. Census data by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies shows that **about one‑third (33 percent) of all U.S. households were cost‑burdened**, spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, while **16 percent were severely cost‑burdened**, spending more than half【541030972797839†L244-L249】.  About **20.7 million homeowner households (24 percent of homeowners)** and **22.7 million renter households (49 percent of renters)** were cost‑burdened in 2024【541030972797839†L271-L276】.  Renter households have been hit especially hard: between 2019 and 2024, **rents rose 38 percent while renter incomes rose only 28 percent**【541030972797839†L278-L280】.  The burden is spreading beyond low‑income renters to middle‑income households; almost half of renters earning \$45,000–\$74,999 were cost‑burdened in 2024, up nearly 10 percentage points since 2019【541030972797839†L303-L309】.  Older homeowners are also increasingly strained as rising non‑mortgage costs (utilities, insurance and taxes) erode fixed incomes【541030972797839†L286-L299】.

### Putting it together

When we look across these essentials—housing, food, transportation, healthcare, childcare and energy—the picture is clear.  Average income figures and headline GDP growth do not tell us whether people can meet basic needs without unsustainable debt.  Measures that adjust for inflation and differences in consumption patterns show that some groups face higher prices and lower purchasing power than others【487696743123867†L724-L734】.  PPPs remind us that cross‑country comparisons must account for differences in price levels and consumption baskets【91517381116141†L119-L133】.  Wages at the middle lag behind top incomes【973626928018500†L31-L68】, and costs for essentials are rising faster than many incomes【541030972797839†L278-L280】.

## Conclusion

This chapter defined the economic scoreboard we will use throughout the book.  GDP tells us the value of what is produced, while GNI tells us who earns the income.  Mean incomes can conceal the realities experienced by most people, so medians matter.  Adjusting nominal values for inflation and using PPPs is essential for making meaningful comparisons across time and borders.  Finally, focusing on **affordability of essentials**—housing, food, energy, healthcare, childcare and transportation—reveals that living standards are about much more than average output.  Many households, especially those with low incomes or in expensive cities, struggle to cover basic needs despite economic growth.  The rest of the book builds on this foundation to explore how population, prices, technology and policy shape the prospects for abundance or scarcity.
