# Abundance, Scarcity, and Who Gets What  
## Population, Technology, Money, and Inequality in the World Economy (Past, Present, and Next Century)

> **What this outline is:** a 3-level structure (Parts → Chapters → Sections) for a book-length manuscript, with a short purpose statement per chapter.  
> **What it is not:** final chapter text. It is the scaffolding the quantitative backbone and narrative will hang on.

## PART I — WHAT WE’RE MEASURING (AND WHY MOST DEBATES TALK PAST EACH OTHER)

### Chapter 1 — Growth, Wellbeing, and “Affordability of Life”
#### 1.1 GDP, GNI, and why location of production vs ownership matters  
#### 1.2 GDP per capita vs median income: why averages can mislead  
#### 1.3 Inflation, “real” vs “nominal,” and why baskets differ by class  
#### 1.4 PPP (purchasing power parity) and why cross-country comparisons break  
#### 1.5 A practical welfare lens: essentials affordability + health + security + opportunity  

**Purpose:** Define the scoreboard. “GDP” is the value of production; it is not the same thing as living standards, and it hides distribution. This chapter locks definitions (GDP vs GNI, real vs nominal, PPP, median vs mean) and introduces the book’s core welfare output: whether a typical household can afford essentials (housing, food, energy, healthcare, childcare, transport) without unsustainable debt.

---

### Chapter 2 — The Master Identity: GDP = Population × GDP per Capita
#### 2.1 Growth-rate decomposition in plain language  
#### 2.2 Why population growth can raise GDP while leaving people no better off  
#### 2.3 “Population blind spot”: why forecasters and pundits underweight demography  
#### 2.4 What to track instead: per-capita growth, median outcomes, and dependency ratios  

**Purpose:** Put a simple identity at the center and use it to clear confusion. Many arguments about “growth” are really arguments about population vs productivity. This chapter shows how to decompose growth cleanly and why ignoring population breaks forecasting—especially over 20–50 year horizons.

---

### Chapter 3 — A Very Short Economic History of Scarcity and Surplus
#### 3.1 Pre‑industrial constraints: land, energy, disease, and coercion  
#### 3.2 The industrial break: fossil energy + machines + urban scale  
#### 3.3 Post‑1950 acceleration: health, education, and global integration  
#### 3.4 Why the last 70 years were unusual (and may not repeat)  

**Purpose:** Provide historical orientation without romanticizing the past. The key point: for most of history, productivity gains were eaten by population growth (Malthusian dynamics). The modern era broke that pattern through energy abundance and technology diffusion. The rest of the book asks which parts of that break are robust and which are fragile.

---

## PART II — DEMOGRAPHY: MORE THAN “HOW MANY PEOPLE”

### Chapter 4 — Age Structure: The Producer–Consumer Balance
#### 4.1 Dependency ratios (children + elderly vs working-age)  
#### 4.2 The demographic dividend: mechanism, timing, and limits  
#### 4.3 Participation rates and why “working-age” isn’t “working”  
#### 4.4 Migration as a demographic policy lever (and its constraints)  

**Purpose:** Make age structure operational. The “demographic dividend” is not magic; it’s a temporary period when a high share of working-age people can raise output per person and fiscal room. This chapter explains the mechanism (more producers per dependent), why it fades, and why institutions determine whether the dividend becomes broad prosperity or elite capture.

---

### Chapter 5 — Demography and Affordability: What Gets Cheaper, What Doesn’t
#### 5.1 How labor supply changes wages and service prices  
#### 5.2 Why tradable goods often fall in price in high-worker eras  
#### 5.3 Aging and the care bottleneck: healthcare, eldercare, and labor intensity  
#### 5.4 Household formation vs population: why housing demand can stay high  
#### 5.5 Fertility feedback loops: housing costs, childcare, and family formation  

**Purpose:** Connect demography directly to lived costs. Some prices are flexible and global; others are local, regulated, and labor-intensive. Demography pushes hardest on services and housing through labor supply, household formation, and care needs—exactly where many societies experience affordability stress.

---

## PART III — PRICES AND SCARCITY: TRADABLES, SERVICES, AND BOTTLENECKS

### Chapter 6 — Tradables vs Non‑Tradables (and Why This Explains “Cheap TVs, Expensive Life”)
#### 6.1 Tradable goods: global competition and rapid productivity  
#### 6.2 Non‑tradable services: local labor + regulation + limited scale  
#### 6.3 Baumol cost disease: why many services rise relative to goods  
#### 6.4 Price indices and class: why inflation feels different by income  

**Purpose:** Explain the single most important pattern behind modern cost-of-living frustration: manufactured goods get cheaper, while housing, healthcare, education, and care services rise. The mechanism is not “greed” as an explanation—it’s the structural combination of productivity differences, local constraints, and regulation.

---

### Chapter 7 — Scarcity by Nature vs Scarcity by Policy
#### 7.1 Scarce-by-nature: land, location, attention, unique resources  
#### 7.2 Scarce-by-policy: zoning, permitting, licensing, and market entry rules  
#### 7.3 The “permitting economy”: administrative capacity as a factor of production  
#### 7.4 When rules create rents: who captures them and how it shows up in prices  

**Purpose:** Separate what cannot be scaled (prime land, attention) from what could be scaled but isn’t (housing permits, grid hookups, clinician supply). This distinction matters because monetary policy cannot fix a permitting bottleneck, and technology only helps if institutions allow scaling.

---

### Chapter 8 — Global Supply Chains, Trade Regimes, and Inflation
#### 8.1 Globalization as a price system: why it lowered goods inflation  
#### 8.2 Deglobalization and resilience: redundancy costs money  
#### 8.3 Choke points as the new oil: chips, minerals, shipping lanes, data centers  
#### 8.4 Terms of trade and who pays: consumers, workers, or the state  

**Purpose:** Show how trade structure changes affordability. Global supply chains expanded effective labor and capital pools; fragmentation reduces that pool and raises costs. The distributional question is always: do higher costs show up as lower wages, higher consumer prices, lower profits, or higher taxes?

---

## PART IV — TECHNOLOGY WAVES AND “SYNTHETIC LABOR”

### Chapter 9 — Growth Accounting Without Mysticism (Labor × Capital × TFP)
#### 9.1 Labor: workers, participation, hours, skills  
#### 9.2 Capital: machines, software, infrastructure, housing (and why housing is weird)  
#### 9.3 TFP (total factor productivity): “doing more with what you have”  
#### 9.4 Why measured productivity often lags real innovation  
#### 9.5 Diffusion: why adoption, not invention, drives living standards  

**Purpose:** Provide the book’s production engine in plain language. Growth comes from more inputs (labor, capital) or better use of inputs (TFP). The biggest practical issue is diffusion: the gains exist but do not spread evenly across firms, regions, or workers.

---

### Chapter 10 — AI (Next 5–15 Years): Cognitive Automation and Market Power
#### 10.1 Tasks vs jobs: what is automatable and what stays human  
#### 10.2 Trust, liability, and legitimacy constraints (why “can” isn’t “will”)  
#### 10.3 Compute as a factor of production: chips, data centers, energy  
#### 10.4 Second-order effects: concentration, pricing power, superstar firms  
#### 10.5 Distribution: who captures gains (workers, consumers, owners, governments)  

**Purpose:** Replace hype with mechanisms and constraints. AI is likely to expand the supply of certain cognitive tasks (“synthetic labor”), but bottlenecks (compute, data, regulation, liability) and market concentration shape who wins. Without competition and diffusion, AI can raise GDP while widening inequality.

---

### Chapter 11 — Biotechnology (15–30 Years): Health, Aging, Food, and Materials
#### 11.1 Healthspan vs lifespan: why extra years can be costly or liberating  
#### 11.2 Scale-up bottlenecks: trials, regulation, manufacturing, cold chains  
#### 11.3 Food systems and materials: productivity vs ecological limits  
#### 11.4 Fiscal math: pensions, healthcare spending, and dependency ratios  
#### 11.5 Distribution: access, pricing, and the politics of longevity  

**Purpose:** Treat biology as a macroeconomic variable. If health improvements compress morbidity (less illness), they ease the care bottleneck. If they extend life without health, they increase dependency and fiscal strain. Either way, inequality determines whether biotech becomes mass welfare or luxury longevity.

---

### Chapter 12 — Robotics + Energy (20–60 Years): Physical Automation Meets Power Constraints
#### 12.1 Structured vs messy environments: why factories automate before homes  
#### 12.2 Safety and liability as deployment constraints  
#### 12.3 Energy as the hidden input: abundance vs scarcity pathways  
#### 12.4 Critical minerals and industrial capacity: scaling limits  
#### 12.5 Ownership: who owns robots determines inequality outcomes  

**Purpose:** Physical automation changes wages and prices only if energy and supply chains can scale. The limiting factor may be not “robot brains” but power, minerals, manufacturing, and safety regulation. Ownership concentration can convert productivity into rent extraction rather than cheaper living.

---

## PART V — INEQUALITY: THE DISTRIBUTION LAYER MOST MODELS TREAT AS OPTIONAL (IT IS NOT)

### Chapter 13 — Income Inequality: Why Median Can Stall While Mean Rises
#### 13.1 Skill‑biased technological change and task replacement  
#### 13.2 Globalization, offshoring, and bargaining power  
#### 13.3 Monopsony and concentration: when employers have local power  
#### 13.4 Unions, institutions, and wage-setting regimes  
#### 13.5 Pre‑tax vs post‑tax: what the state does (or doesn’t) offset  

**Purpose:** Explain the central paradox of rich-country politics: the economy “grows” while many households feel stuck. The mechanism is distribution—who gets the productivity gains. This chapter lays out competing explanations and how to test them with data.

---

### Chapter 14 — Wealth Inequality, Asset Inflation, and Intergenerational Conflict
#### 14.1 Housing as both shelter and leveraged asset  
#### 14.2 Low rates and QE: why asset prices respond more than wages  
#### 14.3 Inheritance and mobility: when opportunity becomes family-bound  
#### 14.4 Insurance retreat from climate risk: the next wealth shock channel  
#### 14.5 Feedback loops: inequality → policy capture → more inequality  

**Purpose:** Show why wealth inequality is stickier than income inequality. Asset price booms transfer wealth to owners and raise entry barriers for newcomers. This creates intergenerational conflict (homeowners vs renters; retirees vs workers) and can lock in political stalemates that preserve scarcity.

---

## PART VI — MONEY, CREDIT, AND MACRO: WHAT CENTRAL BANKS CAN AND CANNOT DO

### Chapter 15 — Money and Credit in Plain Language
#### 15.1 Credit creation: how bank lending expands spending power  
#### 15.2 Nominal vs real interest rates: what households actually feel  
#### 15.3 Inflation expectations: why beliefs change behavior  
#### 15.4 The neutral rate (r*): the rate consistent with stable inflation  
#### 15.5 QE/QT: what changes and what doesn’t  

**Purpose:** Demystify the monetary system. Money is not just coins; it’s mostly credit. Central banks move rates to influence borrowing, spending, and inflation. But they cannot create housing permits, nurses, or grid capacity. This chapter sets up later distributional analysis.

---

### Chapter 16 — Monetary Transmission and Distribution
#### 16.1 Rates → credit → demand → employment → inflation (the standard channel)  
#### 16.2 Rates → asset prices → wealth distribution (the underrated channel)  
#### 16.3 Inflation as redistribution: debtors vs creditors; essentials hit the poor  
#### 16.4 High rates: affordability vs unemployment trade-offs  
#### 16.5 Demography and technology vs inflation: competing theories and evidence  

**Purpose:** Integrate money into affordability. Low rates can ease monthly payments but inflate asset prices; high rates can cool inflation but crush entrants and raise job risk. The “right” policy depends on whether inflation is demand-driven or supply/bottleneck-driven.

---

## PART VII — FOUR FOCAL CASES: USA, GERMANY, CHINA, AND FAST‑GROWING AFRICA

### Chapter 17 — United States: Innovation Leader, High Essential Costs
#### 17.1 Demography, migration, and labor markets  
#### 17.2 Housing scarcity and local veto points  
#### 17.3 Healthcare pricing, administration, and labor constraints  
#### 17.4 Inequality and the role of market power  
#### 17.5 Scenarios: diffusion boom vs concentration trap vs fragmentation vs climate stress  

**Purpose:** Explain why the US can be rich in output and poor in affordability. The mechanisms are housing and healthcare scarcity-by-policy, plus strong returns to capital and superstar firms. The case study tests how institutions mediate technology gains.

---

### Chapter 18 — Germany: Aging, Industry, and the Energy Constraint
#### 18.1 Demography and the care/workforce squeeze  
#### 18.2 Manufacturing strength and export dependence  
#### 18.3 Energy transition and cost structure  
#### 18.4 Wage bargaining institutions and distribution  
#### 18.5 Scenarios: green reindustrialization vs stagnation vs fragmentation  

**Purpose:** Germany is a clean test of how an aging society with strong institutions handles energy shocks and industrial competition. The distribution story differs from the US because labor institutions and social insurance matter.

---

### Chapter 19 — China: Rapid Rise, Rapid Aging, Property and Debt
#### 19.1 Demographic reversal and shrinking workforce  
#### 19.2 Urbanization and the property-centered growth model  
#### 19.3 Industrial policy, technology, and external constraints  
#### 19.4 Inequality, regional gaps, and social contract pressures  
#### 19.5 Scenarios: productivity pivot vs debt drag vs geopolitical choke points  

**Purpose:** China tests the “aging before rich” problem and the limits of investment-led growth when demographics turn. It also shows how geopolitics can act as a binding constraint on technology diffusion.

---

### Chapter 20 — Fast‑Growing African Economies: Youth Bulge as Dividend or Bomb
#### 20.1 Demography and the employment challenge  
#### 20.2 Energy and infrastructure as binding constraints  
#### 20.3 Education quality, health, and state capacity  
#### 20.4 Urbanization, housing, and informality  
#### 20.5 Scenarios: job-rich growth vs stalled transition vs climate stress  

**Purpose:** Africa is the world’s biggest demographic swing factor this century. Whether that becomes global growth and welfare gains depends on energy access, governance, education, and the ability to create tradable jobs—not just population size.

---

## PART VIII — PLANETARY CONSTRAINTS, INSTITUTIONS, AND TAIL RISKS

### Chapter 21 — Climate, Water, Food, and the New Geography of Risk
#### 21.1 Mitigation vs adaptation: what each does to prices and welfare  
#### 21.2 Water stress and food systems: yield, trade, and conflict risks  
#### 21.3 Climate migration and urban pressure  
#### 21.4 Insurance retreat: when markets stop underwriting assets  

**Purpose:** Tie planetary constraints to affordability and wealth. Climate risk increasingly shows up through insurance, credit availability, and housing values—distributional channels that hit households long before global averages move.

---

### Chapter 22 — Institutions: The Capacity to Build, Enforce, and Legitimize
#### 22.1 Rule of law, corruption, and investment  
#### 22.2 State capacity and the bottleneck economy  
#### 22.3 Social trust and compliance (why policy fails even when “right”)  
#### 22.4 Polarization and misinformation as macro variables  

**Purpose:** Institutions are not “soft” variables; they determine whether societies can scale housing, energy, healthcare, and infrastructure. This chapter explains how legitimacy and administrative capacity convert resources into welfare—or squander them.

---

### Chapter 23 — Tail Risks and Shock Cascades
#### 23.1 Pandemics and biosecurity: fast shocks, long scars  
#### 23.2 Financial crises: leverage, housing, and feedback loops  
#### 23.3 Cyber and infrastructure fragility  
#### 23.4 War, sanctions, and industrial mobilization  
#### 23.5 How shocks reshape inequality (who can hedge, who cannot)  

**Purpose:** Stress-test the model. Shocks don’t hit evenly; they expose existing fragilities (housing leverage, supply chain concentration, weak institutions). This chapter provides a practical risk map for the next century.

---

## PART IX — THE NEXT 30–100 YEARS: SCENARIOS, NOT PROPHECY

### Chapter 24 — Scenario Engine: Demography × Technology × Energy × Geopolitics × Institutions
#### 24.1 How to read scenarios: assumptions, mechanisms, and uncertainty bands  
#### 24.2 What is likely vs what is merely possible  
#### 24.3 Distribution-first scenario evaluation (median welfare, not just GDP)  
#### 24.4 Policy levers vs structural constraints: what can actually change outcomes  

**Purpose:** Turn the book into a forecasting discipline rather than a narrative of inevitability. The question is not “will tech save us?” but “under which conditions does tech lower essential costs for the median household?”

---

### Chapter 25 — Who Gets What: Designing Broad Pass-Through
#### 25.1 Competition and diffusion: preventing rent extraction  
#### 25.2 Labor institutions for the synthetic-labor era  
#### 25.3 Housing/energy/healthcare supply reforms: the non-monetary fixes  
#### 25.4 Tax/transfer and public services: cushioning shocks and widening opportunity  
#### 25.5 Measuring success: the affordability dashboard  

**Purpose:** Close with decision-relevant takeaways. Broad welfare gains require pass-through: productivity must show up as lower essential prices, higher median wages, better public services, or shorter working time. That does not happen automatically; it depends on institutions, competition, and supply capacity.

---
